# Meteor Poker
this script saves you a click at the Kreludor meteor and chooses the "poke with a stick" option. that's literally it.

# Quest Log Streak View
forgot to claim your prize because you didn't click on "Streak Reward" and notice it was ready? me too. this script will:
* show your daily quest progress and streak progress at the same time, similar to how it looked in the original Quest Log.
* hide the extra "Let's Go" section under your quests.<br><br>
