a Gormball companion script for lovers of the game.<br><br>
<img width="400px" height="auto" src="https://i.imgur.com/4pe2a4j.png"><br><br>
features:
* display your possible score (aka the neopoints you will earn) if you win the game.
* see a picture of the player in action when it's their move.
* have a favorite character to play as? edit the script and change <i>myFavoritePlayer</i> to their name. before you start a new game, they will be automatically selected for you!
* add a link to the Gormball Neopedia page to read up on past championship games.
* if you're not using the Ruffle extension, replace the broken animation with a <a href="https://items.jellyneo.net/item/76724/">piccy</a>.
* replace the player bio images with images of their plushies, because that's pretty cute.
* i won a trophy testing this script. that's not a feature, i just want you to be happy for me.

have fun playing and back Farvin III for enby rights!
