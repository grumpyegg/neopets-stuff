* displays your possible score (aka the neopoints you will earn) if you win the game.
* shows an image of the player in action when it's their move.
* have a favorite character to play as? edit the script and change <i>myFavoritePlayer</i> to their name. before you start a new game, they will be already chosen!
* adds a link to the Gormball Neopedia page to read up on past championship games.
* if you're not using the Ruffle extension, replaces the broken flash animation with a piccy.
* replaces the player bio images with images of their plushies, because that's pretty cute.
* i won a trophy while testing this script. that's not a feature, i just want you to be happy for me.

have fun playing and back Farvin III for enby rights!
