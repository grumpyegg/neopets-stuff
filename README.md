# Meteor Poker
this script saves you a click at the Kreludor meteor and chooses the "poke with a stick" option. that's literally it.

# Quest Log Streak View
forgot to claim your prize because you didn't click on "Streak Reward" and notice it was ready? me too. this script will show your daily quest progress and streak progress at the same time, similar to how it looked in the original Quest Log.<br>(also hides the extra "Let's Go" section under your quests)<br><br>

# "Watch Ad" Buttons-Be-Gone! (for non-Premium players)
not interested in a premium membership? tired of the options to watch an ad at every turn? this script says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vA8yG5b1g0">nuh-uh</a> to looking at extra ads, hiding a variety of buttons and other promos.

<b><u>DISCLAIMER</u>: this script DOES NOT act as an ad blocker!!!!</b> nor does it remove any of the regular advertisements served to you on on neopets pages. it simply hides some optional ads and promotions from view.

buttons to watch ads will be hidden in the following places:
* homepage
* wheels of excitement, knowledge, mediocrity, misfortune, extragavance, monotony
* battledome
* faerie caverns
* the void within: volunteer centre, lost in the dark, attack on altador

also hidden: "learn more" premium perk ads (i.e. in the games room), grave danger fortune cookie ad, void attractor prototype ad.

if you'd like to customize which of these ads are available, simply edit the script and comment out ("//") any of the styles you don't want to be hidden.
